# Knowledge self paced learning

The aim of this section is to build some sites related to Knowledge. As part of the workshop, you can build what you want and feel inspired to be creative so these should be seen as a suggestion rather than a mandatory guide of what to build.

The instructions listed below provide guidance on how to create the sites but additional materials are available in linked Microsoft Learn articles (eapecially as so much of this changes so quickly that we want to ensure younhave future info!).
