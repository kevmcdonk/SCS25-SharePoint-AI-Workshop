# Collaboration self paced learning

The aim of this section is to build some sites related to Collaboration. As part of the workshop, you can build what you want and feel inspired to be creative so these should be seen as a suggestion rather than a mandatory guide of what to build.

The insturctions listed below provide guidance on how to create the sites but additional materials are available in linked Microsoft Learn articles (eapecially as so much of this changes so quickly that we want to ensure younhave future info!).

## Scenario

You are setting up a new set of sites to improve your project governance, ensuring a new PMO function has the tools to understand what projects are happening and all employees have visibility of those projects.

#### Overview

You will focus on three key areas:

- PMO Site - main Project Management Office site that lists the projects and acts as the main repository for guidance
- Project Site - site created for each project
- Integration - connection to other systems

## PMO Site

#### Create PMO Site

- Head to main SharePoint Page - https://{your-tenant}.sharepoint.com/_layouts/15/sharepoint.aspx

- Create a communication site and call it PMO-{YOUR INITIALS}, choosing whichever template you like

![Template]()

#### Create Project List

- On the home page, click on new and add a new List

- Select the blank list and call it projects

- Add some useful columns that must include SiteUrl and then can have others you see fit e.g. description, key initiative, project owner etc.

#### Create an automation

- Click on the Integrate menu and select Power Automate then Create a flow

Select Request approval in Teams (unless you want to be more inspired)

![Template]()
![Template]()

#### Set up the Flow

	- Configure the “Create an approval (V2)” action and the “Send an email” action

	- You will have to remove the optional fields in the approval action and potentially refresh the page.

 ![Template]()

#### Add create site action

	- Add an action after the approval notification for “Send an HTTP request to SharePoint”

- Set the Site address to the root site

- Set the method to Post

- Set the Uri to _api/SPSiteManager/create

- Add the two advanced parameters

- Add the Headers
	
	- Accept: application/json;odata=none
	
	- Content-Type: application/json

-Add the Body:
	
	- {  "request": {    "Title": "@{triggerBody()?['Title']}",    "Url": "https://yourtenant.sharepoint.com/sites/@{triggerBody()?['SiteUrl']}",    "Lcid": 1033,    "ShareByEmailEnabled": false,    "Description": "Site for project collaboration",    "WebTemplate": "STS#3",    "Owner": "@{outputs('Get_my_profile_(V2)')?['body/mail']}"  }}

#### Create a Project Document

	- Ask Copilot to create a sample Project Document – do this from a blank document as some of the templates do not work well with Content Assembly

- Follow these steps to automate it with Content Assembly in the PMO Site
	
	- Create a modern template | Microsoft Learn

- Potentially set up a flow on creation to copy to Project Site

 ![Template]()

#### Create a Project Site

- Head to main SharePoint Page at https://{your-tenant}.sharepoint.com/_layouts/15/sharepoint.aspx

- Create a team site and call it whatever you like to match a project name, choosing the Project Site template

- Head to the Documents section

- Click on new and select Word document

- Now is your chance to get creative – use SharePoint to make a prompt for a type of project document
	
	• Requirements specification
	
	• Design document
	
	• Change document
	
	• Status Report

- Running out of time? We have some sample content to copy at XXXX
