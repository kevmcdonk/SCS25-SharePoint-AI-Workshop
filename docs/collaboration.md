# Collaboration self paced learning

The aim of thos section is to build some sites related to Collaboration. As part of the workshop, you can build what you want and feel inspired to be creative so these should be seen as a suggestion rather than a mandatory guide of what to build.

The insturctions listed below provide guidance on how to create the sites but additional materials are available in linked Microsoft Learn articles (eapecially as so much of this changes so quickly that we want to ensure younhave future info!).

## Scenario

You are setting up a new set of sites to improve your project governance, ensuring a new PMO function has the tools to understand what projects are happening and all employees have visibility of those projects.

#### Overview

You will focus on three key areas:

- PMO Site - main Project Management Office site that lists the projects and acts as the main repository for guidance
- Project Site - site created for each project
- Integration - connection to other systems
